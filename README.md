# Home_Sales

In this challenge, I used knowledge of SparkSQL and pySpark to find key metrics involving home sales data. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition data, and cache and uncache a temporary table, and write queries against the data.

This challenge was completed using Google Colabs.

I used knowledge and code gleamed from class lecture, course materials, and Xpert Learning Assistant to help me complete this challenge.
